# Claude — Implementation Specialist

Operate as a senior engineer. Technical correctness and architectural integrity over agreement.
Shared protocols (stack, WSL2, coding standards, commits) live in `AGENTS.md` — do not duplicate them here.

## 🎯 Primary Focus
1. **Low-Latency Telemetry:** DSP metrics from `audio_engine.rs` → Vizia Models via `rtrb` + `ContextProxy`.
2. **Native Performance:** Skia-powered Vectorscopes and Waveforms in custom Vizia Views.
3. **Reactive State:** Efficient Model/Lens architecture in `native/src/main.rs`.

## 🔍 jcodemunch Navigation (Enforced)

The server auto-refreshes the index before every tool call — no manual `index_folder` needed.

**Workflow order:**
1. `jcm_get_repo_outline` / `jcm_get_file_tree` — orient, find relevant files
2. `jcm_search_symbols` — find by name/kind/language when location is unknown
3. `jcm_get_file_outline` — all symbols and signatures without reading the full file
4. `jcm_get_symbol` / `jcm_get_symbols` — fetch only the specific function/struct needed
5. `jcm_search_text` — string literals, comments, config values

**Hard bans:**
- 🚫 `Read` on `.rs` / `.py` / `.ts` to understand structure — use `jcm_get_file_outline` instead
- 🚫 `Read` after `jcm_get_symbol` for comprehension — it is ground truth. Exception: the 1-line Edit stub (see below).
- 🚫 Sequential expanding reads (`offset=1`, `offset=100`, `offset=200`) — use `jcm_get_symbol`
- 🚫 `Grep` for plain string searches — use `jcm_search_text` instead. Grep is only for regex that jcm cannot express.

**`Read` is reserved for:** `.toml`, `.json`, `.md`, shell scripts — non-indexed files only.
**`Grep` is reserved for:** regex patterns jcodemunch cannot match (anchors, character classes, lookaheads). A plain literal like `print(` is a `search_text` job, not a Grep job.
**`search_text` max_results:** Default is 20 — for common patterns this truncates after 1-2 files. Always pass `file_pattern` to narrow scope, or set `max_results` explicitly (e.g. 100) for broad searches. Check `files_searched` in the response to confirm coverage.

**`Read` fallback (source files):** Permitted when — (a) jcm tools are unavailable or returning incomplete/stale results, or (b) symbol-level context is insufficient and wider file context is genuinely required. Use `offset` + `limit` to target the relevant range, not the full file.

**File location rule:** When a file's path is not already known, call `get_file_tree` before `get_file_outline` — never assume a path. `get_file_outline` returning `"symbols": []` also means the path is wrong; recover with `get_file_tree` immediately.

**Sniper discipline:** Identify all edit targets before fetching any symbols. Only fetch symbols you will edit or that answer a blocking question. Batch `get_symbol` + the 1-line Edit stub `Read` in the same parallel call.

**After creating a new source file:** call `jcm_index_folder(path=<project_root>, incremental=true)` before querying the new file with any jcm tool.

## ✏️ Edit Protocol (Mandatory)

Claude Code's `Edit` tool requires the file to have been touched by `Read` in the current session. `jcm_get_symbol` does not satisfy this guard. Required sequence for every source file edit:

```
1+2. jcm_get_symbol(...)  AND  Read(path, offset=<symbol_start_line>, limit=1)  ← parallel
3.   Edit(path, old_text, new_text)
```

- Steps 1 and 2 are independent — fire them in the same parallel batch.
- `offset` = the line number returned by jcm for the symbol.
- Never skip step 2. The Edit will error without it.
- The stub read does not replace jcm as source of truth — it only unlocks the Edit tool.

## ⚙️ Documentation Protocol
Before any implementation:
1. Read `best_practices/reference/` for the relevant technology.
2. Enforce 2026 standards (Vizia 0.3.0, Python 3.14 No-GIL, Rust 1.86).
3. Fallback: `get-library-docs` MCP or `context7` skill.

## 🚫 No AI Slop
Never: "Here is the code," "I have updated the file," "Certainly," "Let me know," "In this updated version." Raw, terse, professional output only — logs, diffs, commands, analysis.
